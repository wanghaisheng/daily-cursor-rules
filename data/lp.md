# Landing Page Communication Framework for LLMs

## Core Principles

### 1. Process Communication Model (PCM)
Ensure messaging speaks to all six personality types:

- **Thinkers**: Logic and data-driven
  - Focus: Structured information, clear outcomes
  - Example: "Convert raw input into structured output"

- **Harmonizers**: Emotion and compassion-driven
  - Focus: Personal impact, community benefits
  - Example: "Finally caught up with your backlog"

- **Rebels**: Reaction and humor-driven
  - Focus: Breaking free from tedious work
  - Example: "Done with manual busywork? ðŸ˜Ž"

- **Promoters**: Action and charm-driven
  - Focus: Quick wins, immediate results
  - Example: "One upload = endless opportunities"

- **Persisters**: Value and opinion-driven
  - Focus: Quality outcomes, trusted results
  - Example: "Quality in, more value out"

- **Imaginers**: Reflection and imagination-driven
  - Focus: Possibilities, potential outcomes
  - Example: "Unlock hidden potential"

### 2. ARCS Copywriting Formula

- **Ask**: Start with a "yes" question
- **Reveal**: Show understanding of their situation
- **Call**: Present the solution/discovery
- **Send**: Clear call to action

### 3. Landing Page Structure Best Practices

1. Hero Section:
```
Headline: Core Transformation
Subhead: Specific Outcome
â€¢ Key Benefit 1
â€¢ Key Benefit 2
â€¢ Risk Reducer
[Primary CTA] [Secondary CTA]
```

2. Social Proof:
```
"Specific Result + Emotional Impact"
- Name, Role
```

3. Use Cases:
- Group by outcome, not features
- Show transformation
- Include quick wins

4. Pricing:
- Focus on value tiers
- Simple, clear benefits
- Risk reducers (guarantees, trial)

## Communication Guidelines

### 1. Value Proposition Formula
```
[Transform X] into [Desired Outcome]
Get [Specific Result] in [Timeframe]
```

### 2. Clarity Checklist
- What they get (specific output)
- How fast (timeframe)
- Who it's for/not for (qualification)
- Immediate value (free/trial offer)
- Social proof (user results)
- Clear next step (risk-free CTA)

### 3. Content Categories

Emotional Transformation:
- Before state â†’ After state
- Pain point â†’ Relief
- Problem â†’ Solution

Practical Transformation:
- Input â†’ Output
- Raw material â†’ Finished product
- Single use â†’ Multiple uses

### 4. Risk Reduction Elements

- Free trial/tier
- No credit card required
- Money-back guarantee
- Support availability
- Clear limitations
