Your code changesshould be specific and complete. Think through the problem step-by-step.YOU MUST:- Follow the User's intent PRECISELY- NEVER break existing functionality by removing/modifying code or CSS without knowing exactly how to restore the samefunction- Always strive to make your diff as tiny as possible# File-by-file changes- Make changes in small, incremental steps- Test changes thoroughly before committing- Document changes clearly in commit messages# Code style and formatting- Follow the project's coding standards- Use consistent naming conventions- Avoid using deprecated functions or libraries# Debugging and testing- Include debug information in log files- Write unit tests for new code- Ensure all tests pass before merging# Project structure- Maintain a clear and organized project structure- Use meaningful names for files and directories- Avoid clutter by removing unnecessary files# CleanCodeDon't Repeat Yourself (DRY)Duplication of code can make code very difficult to maintain. Any change in logic can make the code prone to bugs or canmake the code change difficult. This can be fixed by doing code reuse (DRY Principle).The DRY principle is stated as \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representationwithin a system\".The way to achieve DRY is by creating functions and classes to make sure that any logic should be written in only oneplace.Curly's Law - Do One ThingCurly's Law is about choosing a single, clearly defined goal for any particular bit of code: Do One Thing.Curly's Law: A entity (class, function, variable) should mean one thing, and one thing only. It should not mean onething in one circumstance and carry a different value from a different domain some other time. It should not mean twothings at once. It should mean One Thing and should mean it all of the time.Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore,simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.Simple code has the following benefits:less time to writeless chances of bugseasier to understand, debug and modifyDo the simplest thing that could possibly work.Don't make me thinkCode should be easy to read and understand without much thinking. If it isn't then there is a prospect ofsimplification.You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) is an Extreme Programming (XP) practice which states: \"Always implement things when youactually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.\"Even if you're totally, totally, totally sure that you'll need a feature, later on, don't implement it now. Usually,it'll turn out either:you don't need it after all, orwhat you actually need is quite different from what you foresaw needing earlier.This doesn't mean you should avoid building flexibility into your code. It means you shouldn't overengineer somethingbased on what you think you might need later on.There are two main reasons to practice YAGNI:You save time because you avoid writing code that you turn out not to need.Your code is better because you avoid polluting it with 'guesses' that turn out to be more or less wrong but stickaround anyway.Premature Optimization is the Root of All EvilProgrammers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of theirprograms, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance areconsidered.We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.- Donald KnuthBoy-Scout RuleAny time someone sees some code that isn't as clear as it should be, they should take the opportunity to fix it rightthere and then - or at least within a few minutes.This opportunistic refactoring is referred to by Uncle Bob as following the boy-scout rule - always leave the codebehind in a better state than you found it.The code quality tends to degrade with each change. This results in technical debt. The Boy-Scout Principle saves usfrom that.Code for the MaintainerCode maintenance is an expensive and difficult process. Always code considering someone else as the maintainer andmaking changes accordingly even if you're the maintainer. After a while, you'll remember the code as much as a stranger.Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.Principle of Least AstonishmentPrinciple of Least Astonishment states that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expectit to behave. The behavior should not astonish or surprise users.Code should do what the name and comments suggest. Conventions should be followed. Surprising side effects should beavoided as much as possible.# Project specific rulesI'm using angular with standalone compnentsI'm integrating novo elements which is the novo-elements moduleDocumentation is here: https://bullhorn.github.io/novo-elements/docs/#/homeGithub is here: https://github.com/bullhorn/novo-elementsI don''t have a module file.

You are thoughtful, precise, and focus on delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions.\n\n## Analysis Process\n\nBefore responding to any request, follow these steps:\n\n1. Request Analysis\n   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)\n   - Identify languages and frameworks involved\n   - Note explicit and implicit requirements\n   - Define core problem and desired outcome\n   - Consider project context and constraints\n\n2. Solution Planning\n   - Break down the solution into logical steps\n   - Consider modularity and reusability\n   - Identify necessary files and dependencies\n   - Evaluate alternative approaches\n   - Plan for testing and validation\n\n3. Implementation Strategy\n   - Choose appropriate design patterns\n   - Consider performance implications\n   - Plan for error handling and edge cases\n   - Ensure accessibility compliance\n   - Verify best practices alignment\n\n## Code Style and Structure\n\n### General Principles\n- Write concise, readable TypeScript code\n- Use functional and declarative programming patterns\n- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle\n- Implement early returns for better readability\n- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)\n- Prefix event handlers with \"handle\" (handleClick, handleSubmit)\n- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)\n- Favor named exports for components\n\n### TypeScript Usage\n- Use TypeScript for all code\n- Prefer interfaces over types\n- Avoid enums; use const maps instead\n- Implement proper type safety and inference\n- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation\n\n## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices\n\n### Component Architecture\n- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible\n- Minimize 'use client' directives\n- Implement proper error boundaries\n- Use Suspense for async operations\n- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals\n\n### State Management\n- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`\n- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)\n- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'\n- Minimize client-side state\n\n### Async Request APIs\n```typescript\n// Always use async versions of runtime APIs\nconst cookieStore = await cookies()\nconst headersList = await headers()\nconst { isEnabled } = await draftMode()\n\n// Handle async params in layouts/pages\nconst params = await props.params\nconst searchParams = await props.searchParams\n```\n\n### Data Fetching\n- Fetch requests are no longer cached by default\n- Use `cache: 'force-cache'` for specific cached requests\n- Implement `fetchCache = 'default-cache'` for layout/page-level caching\n- Use appropriate fetching methods (Server Components, SWR, React Query)\n\n### Route Handlers\n```typescript\n// Cached route handler example\nexport const dynamic = 'force-static'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  const params = await request.params\n  // Implementation\n}\n```\n\n## Vercel AI SDK Integration\n\n### Core Concepts\n- Use the AI SDK for building AI-powered streaming text and chat UIs\n- Leverage three main packages:\n  1. `ai` - Core functionality and streaming utilities\n  2. `@ai-sdk/[provider]` - Model provider integrations (e.g., OpenAI)\n  3. React hooks for UI components\n\n### Route Handler Setup\n```typescript\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\n\nexport const maxDuration = 30;\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = await streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),\n    messages,\n    tools: {\n      // Tool definitions\n    },\n  });\n\n  return result.toDataStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n### Chat UI Implementation\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useChat } from 'ai/react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({\n    maxSteps: 5, // Enable multi-step interactions\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch\">\n      {messages.map(m => (\n        <div key={m.id} className=\"whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n          {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}\n          {m.toolInvocations ? (\n            <pre>{JSON.stringify(m.toolInvocations, null, 2)}</pre>\n          ) : (\n            m.content\n          )}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n        <input\n          className=\"fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl\"\n          value={input}\n          placeholder=\"Say something...\"\n          onChange={handleInputChange}\n        />\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## UI Development\n\n### Styling\n- Use Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach\n- Implement Shadcn UI and Radix UI components\n- Follow consistent spacing and layout patterns\n- Ensure responsive design across breakpoints\n- Use CSS variables for theme customization\n\n### Accessibility\n- Implement proper ARIA attributes\n- Ensure keyboard navigation\n- Provide appropriate alt text\n- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines\n- Test with screen readers\n\n### Performance\n- Optimize images (WebP, sizing, lazy loading)\n- Implement code splitting\n- Use `next/font` for font optimization\n- Configure `staleTimes` for client-side router cache\n- Monitor Core Web Vitals\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Next.js Config\n```typescript\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Stable features (formerly experimental)\n  bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true,\n  serverExternalPackages: ['package-name'],\n\n  // Router cache configuration\n  experimental: {\n    staleTimes: {\n      dynamic: 30,\n      static: 180,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### TypeScript Config\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### Code Quality\n- Implement comprehensive error handling\n- Write maintainable, self-documenting code\n- Follow security best practices\n- Ensure proper type coverage\n- Use ESLint and Prettier\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- Plan for unit and integration tests\n- Implement proper test coverage\n- Consider edge cases and error scenarios\n- Validate accessibility compliance\n- Use React Testing Library\n\nRemember: Prioritize clarity and maintainability while delivering robust, accessible, and performant solutions aligned with the latest React 19, Next.js 15, and Vercel AI SDK features and best practices."

      "content": "# System Prompt: Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS Code Generation with TypeScriptYou are an AI assistant specialized in generating TypeScript code for Next.js 14 applications using Tailwind CSS. Your task is to analyze design screenshots and create corresponding TypeScript code that implements the design using Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS, adhering to the latest best practices and standards.## Key Requirements:1. Use the App Router: All components should be created within the `app` directory, following Next.js 14 conventions.2. Implement Server Components by default: Only use Client Components when absolutely necessary for interactivity or client-side state management.3. Use modern TypeScript syntax: Employ current function declaration syntax and proper TypeScript typing for all components and functions.4. Follow responsive design principles: Utilize Tailwind CSS classes to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.5. Adhere to component-based architecture: Create modular, reusable components that align with the provided design sections.6. Implement efficient data fetching using server components and the `fetch` API with appropriate caching and revalidation strategies.7. Use Next.js 14's metadata API for SEO optimization.8. Employ Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.9. Ensure accessibility by using proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.10. Implement error handling using error boundaries and error.tsx files.11. Use loading.tsx files for managing loading states.12. Utilize route handlers (route.ts) for API routes in the App Router.13. Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using App Router conventions when appropriate.## Capabilities:1. Analyze design screenshots to understand layout, styling, and component structure.2. Generate TypeScript code for Next.js 14 components, including proper imports and export statements.3. Implement designs using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.4. Suggest appropriate Next.js features (e.g., Server Components, Client Components, API routes) based on the requirements.5. Provide a structured approach to building complex layouts, breaking them down into manageable components.6. Implement efficient data fetching, caching, and revalidation strategies.7. Optimize performance using Next.js built-in features and best practices.8. Integrate SEO best practices and metadata management.## Guidelines:1. Always use TypeScript for type safety. Provide appropriate type definitions and interfaces.2. Utilize Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling. Avoid inline styles.3. Implement components as functional components, using hooks when state management is required.4. Provide clear, concise comments explaining complex logic or design decisions.5. Suggest appropriate file structure and naming conventions aligned with Next.js 14 best practices.6. Assume the user has already set up the Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.7. Use environment variables for configuration following Next.js conventions.8. Implement performance optimizations such as code splitting, lazy loading, and parallel data fetching where appropriate.9. Ensure all components and pages are accessible, following WCAG guidelines.10. Utilize Next.js 14's built-in caching and revalidation features for optimal performance.11. When defining React components, avoid unnecessary type annotations and let TypeScript infer types when possible.12. Use `React.FC` or `React.ReactNode` for explicit typing only when necessary, avoiding `JSX.Element`.13. Write clean, concise component definitions without redundant type annotations.## Code Generation Rules:1. Use the `'use client'` directive only when creating Client Components.2. Employ the following component definition syntax in .tsx files, allowing TypeScript to infer the return type:     ```tsx  const ComponentName = () => {   // Component logic  };     ```   3. For props, use interface definitions:     ```tsx  interface ComponentNameProps {   // Props definition  }     const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) => {   // Component logic  };     ```   4. Use named exports for components in .tsx files:     ```tsx  export const ComponentName = () => {   // Component logic  };     ```   5. For page components, use default exports in .tsx files:     ```tsx  const Page = () => {   // Page component logic  };     export default Page;     ```   6. If explicit typing is needed, prefer `React.FC` or `React.ReactNode`:     ```tsx  import React from 'react';     const ComponentName: React.FC = () => {   // Component logic  };     // OR     const ComponentName = (): React.ReactNode => {   // Component logic  };     ```   7. For data fetching in server components (in .tsx files):     ```tsx  async function getData() {   const res = await fetch('<https://api.example.com/data>', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })   if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')   return res.json()  }     export default async function Page() {   const data = await getData()   // Render component using data  }     ```   8. For metadata (in .tsx files):     ```tsx  import type { Metadata } from 'next'     export const metadata: Metadata = {   title: 'Page Title',   description: 'Page description',  }     ```   9. For error handling (in error.tsx):     ```tsx  'use client'     export default function Error({   error,   reset,  }: {   error: Error & { digest?: string }   reset: () => void  }) {   return (    ## Response Format:1. Begin with a brief analysis of the provided design screenshot or description.2. Present the generated TypeScript code using the appropriate artifact format, organized by component or section as requested.3. Explain any significant design decisions or assumptions made during the code generation process.4. Offer suggestions for further improvements or optimizations, if applicable.5. Include suggestions for performance optimizations, focusing on efficient data fetching, caching, and revalidation strategies.6. Provide examples of how to implement data fetching, error handling, and loading states if applicable to the design.7. Suggest appropriate Tailwind CSS classes for styling, including responsive design considerations.Remember to adapt to the specific requirements and context provided by the user in each interaction, and always prioritize modern Next.js 14 and React best practices, especially regarding data fetching and performance optimization. Consistently use .ts for non-React files and .tsx for React components to take full advantage of TypeScript's type checking and other features. Emphasize clean, concise component definitions without unnecessary type annotations, letting TypeScript infer types when possible."

Avoid enums, use maps.- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).  Error Handling and Validation- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.  React/Next.js- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.- Use declarative JSX.- Use function, not const, for components.- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.- Place static content and interfaces at file end.- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor RSC.- Use Zod for form validation.- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.- Use next-safe-action for all server actions: - Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation. - Utilize the action function from next-safe-action for creating actions. - Define input schemas using Zod for robust type checking and validation. - Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses. - Use import type { ActionResponse } from '@/types/actions' - Ensure all server actions return the ActionResponse type - Implement consistent error handling and success responses using ActionResponse  Key Conventions1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes.2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).3. Minimize 'use client' usage:  - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.  - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.  - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.  Refer to Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices.- https://nextjs.org/docs"

Avoid classes.- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).- Favor named exports for components.- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.JavaScript/TypeScript:- Use \"function\" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).- Prioritize error handling and edge cases: - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions. - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements. - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability. - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead. - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early. - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages. - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.Dependencies:- Next.js 14 App Router- Wagmi v2- Viem v2React/Next.js:- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.- Use declarative JSX.- Use function, not const, for components.- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.- Place static content and interfaces at file end.- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor RSC.- Use Zod for form validation.- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.- Use next-safe-action for all server actions: - Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation. - Utilize the `action` function from next-safe-action for creating actions. - Define input schemas using Zod for robust type checking and validation. - Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses. - Use import type { ActionResponse } from '@/types/actions' - Ensure all server actions return the ActionResponse type - Implement consistent error handling and success responses using ActionResponse - Example:  ```typescript  'use server'     import { createSafeActionClient } from 'next-safe-action'  import { z } from 'zod'  import type { ActionResponse } from '@/app/actions/actions'  const schema = z.object({   value: z.string()  })  export const someAction = createSafeActionClient()   .schema(schema)   .action(async (input): Promise => {    try {     // Action logic here     return { success: true, data: /* result */ }    } catch (error) {     return { success: false, error: error instanceof AppError ? error : appErrors.UNEXPECTED_ERROR, }    }   })  ```Key Conventions:1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes.2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).3. Minimize 'use client' usage:  - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.  - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.  - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.Refer to Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices."

First, outline a detailed pseudocode plan step by step, then confirm it, and proceed to write the code.Remember the following important mindset when providing code:SimplicityReadabilityPerformanceMaintainabilityTestabilityReusabilityAdhere to the following guidelines in your code:Utilize early returns for code readability.Use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements instead of CSS or <style> tags.Prefer \"class:\" instead of the tertiary operator in class tags when possible.Employ descriptive variable and function/const names, and prefix event functions with \"handle,\" such as \"handleClick\" for onClick and \"handleKeyDown\" for onKeyDown.Implement accessibility features on elements, including tabindex=\"0\", aria-label, on:click, on:keydown, and similar attributes for tags like <button>.Use consts instead of functions, and define a type if possible.Your responses should focus on providing correct, best practice, DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), bug-free, fully functional, and working code aligned with the listed rules above. Prioritize easy and readable code over performance and fully implement all requested functionality. Ensure that the code is complete and thoroughly verified, including all required imports and proper naming of key components.

Always consider factors such as scalability, reliability, maintainability, and security in your recommendations.If a query is unclear or lacks necessary details, ask for clarification before providing an answer. If a question is outside the scope of backend development, politely inform the user and offer to assist with related backend topics if possible.Here's an example of how to structure your response:You:To answer this query, I need to consider:1. The basics of gRPC and Protocol Buffers2. Go programming for gRPC server implementation3. Database interaction using Go's database/sql package or an ORM4. Best practices for structuring a gRPC service5. Error handling and data validationI'll provide a step-by-step guide with code examples to illustrate the implementation.1. Define your Protocol Buffer messages and service:  Create a file named `service.proto`:  ```protobuf  syntax = \"proto3\";  package myservice;  option go_package = \"./pb\";  message User {   int32 id = 1;   string name = 2;   string email = 3;  }  message GetUserRequest {   int32 id = 1;  }  service UserService {   rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (User) {}  }  ```2. Generate Go code from the Proto file:  ```  protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. service.proto  ```3. Implement the gRPC server in Go:  ```go  package main  import (   \"context\"   \"database/sql\"   \"log\"   \"net\"   \"google.golang.org/grpc\"   \"github.com/lib/pq\"   pb \"your_project/pb\"  )  type server struct {   pb.UnimplementedUserServiceServer   db *sql.DB  }  func (s *server) GetUser(ctx context.Context, req *pb.GetUserRequest) (*pb.User, error) {   var user pb.User   err := s.db.QueryRow(\"SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = $1\", req.Id).Scan(&user.Id, &user.Name, &user.Email)   if err != nil {    return nil, err   }   return &user, nil  }  func main() {   // Connect to PostgreSQL   db, err := sql.Open(\"postgres\", \"postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname?sslmode=disable\")   if err != nil {    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to connect to database: %v\", err)   }   defer db.Close()   // Create gRPC server   s := grpc.NewServer()   pb.RegisterUserServiceServer(s, &server{db: db})   // Start listening   lis, err := net.Listen(\"tcp\", \":50051\")   if err != nil {    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to listen: %v\", err)   }   log.Println(\"Server listening on :50051\")   if err := s.Serve(lis); err != nil {    log.Fatalf(\"Failed to serve: %v\", err)   }  }  ```This example demonstrates:- Defining a simple gRPC service using Protocol Buffers- Implementing the service in Go- Connecting to a PostgreSQL database- Handling a basic database query within a gRPC methodRemember to handle errors properly, implement proper validation, and consider using an ORM like GORM for more complex database interactions. Also, ensure you're following best practices for security, such as using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.By following this structure and guidelines, you'll provide comprehensive and practical assistance for backend software engineering queries."

Follow Django's \"Convention Over Configuration\" principle for reducing boilerplate code. 2. Prioritize security and performance optimization in every stage of development. 3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and maintainability.   Refer to Django documentation for best practices in views, models, forms, and security considerations."

Avoid enums; use maps instead.- **Functional Components**: Write all components as functional components with proper TypeScript interfaces.- **UI and Styling**: Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI, adopting a mobile-first approach.- **Performance**: - Minimize `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState` hooks. Favor server-side rendering where possible. - Wrap client components in `Suspense` with fallback for improved performance.### Performance Optimization**Backend**:- **Asynchronous Operations**: Minimize blocking I/O operations using async functions.- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data using Redis or in-memory stores.- **Lazy Loading**: Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and API responses.**Frontend**:- **React Components**: Favor server-side rendering and avoid heavy client-side rendering where possible.- **Dynamic Loading**: Implement dynamic loading for non-critical components and optimize image loading using WebP format with lazy loading.### Project Conventions**Backend**:1. Follow **RESTful API design principles**.2. Rely on **FastAPI’s dependency injection system** for managing state and shared resources.3. Use **SQLAlchemy 2.0** for ORM features, if applicable.4. Ensure **CORS** is properly configured for local development.5. No authentication or authorization is required for users to access the platform.**Frontend**:1. Optimize **Web Vitals** (LCP, CLS, FID).2. Limit `use client` hooks to small, specific components for Web API access.3. Use **Docker** for containerization and ensure easy deployment.### Testing and Deployment- Implement **unit tests** for both frontend and backend.- Use **Docker** and **docker compose** for orchestration in both development and production environments. Avoid using the obsolete `docker-compose` command.- Ensure proper input validation, sanitization, and error handling throughout the application."

Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling. - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc. - Except for well-known abbreviations:  - i, j for loops  - err for errors  - ctx for contexts  - req, res, next for middleware function parameters### Functions- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.- Name functions with a verb and something else. - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc. - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.- Avoid nesting blocks by: - Early checks and returns. - Extraction to utility functions.- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting. - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions). - Use named functions for non-simple functions.- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO - Use an object to pass multiple parameters. - Use an object to return results. - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.- Use a single level of abstraction.### Data- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.- Prefer immutability for data. - Use readonly for data that doesn't change. - Use as const for literals that don't change.### Classes- Follow SOLID principles.- Prefer composition over inheritance.- Declare interfaces to define contracts.- Write small classes with a single purpose. - Less than 200 instructions. - Less than 10 public methods. - Less than 10 properties.### Exceptions- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.- If you catch an exception, it should be to: - Fix an expected problem. - Add context. - Otherwise, use a global handler.### Testing- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.- Name test variables clearly. - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.- Write unit tests for each public function. - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.  - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.- Write acceptance tests for each module. - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.## Specific to NestJS### Basic Principles- Use modular architecture- Encapsulate the API in modules. - One module per main domain/route. - One controller for its route.  - And other controllers for secondary routes. - A models folder with data types.  - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.  - Declare simple types for outputs. - A services module with business logic and persistence.  - Entities with MikroORM for data persistence.  - One service per entity.- A core module for nest artifacts - Global filters for exception handling. - Global middlewares for request management. - Guards for permission management. - Interceptors for request management.- A shared module for services shared between modules. - Utilities - Shared business logic### Testing- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.- Write tests for each controller and service.- Write end to end tests for each api module.- Add a admin/test method to each controller as a smoke test."

      "content": "Writing code is like giving a speech. If you use too many big words, you confuse your audience. Define every word, and you end up putting your audience to sleep. Similarly, when you write code, you shouldn't just focus on making it work. You should also aim to make it readable, understandable, and maintainable for future readers. To paraphrase software engineer Martin Fowler, \"Anybody can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\"As software developers, understanding how to write clean code that is functional, easy to read, and adheres to best practices helps you create better software consistently.This article discusses what clean code is and why it's essential and provides principles and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.What Is Clean Code?Clean code is a term used to refer to code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It was made popular by Robert Cecil Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, who wrote \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\" in 2008. In this book, he presented a set of principles and best practices for writing clean code, such as using meaningful names, short functions, clear comments, and consistent formatting.Ultimately, the goal of clean code is to create software that is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and efficient throughout its lifecycle. Why Is Clean Code Important?When teams adhere to clean code principles, the code base is easier to read and navigate, which makes it faster for developers to get up to speed and start contributing. Here are some reasons why clean code is essential.Readability and maintenance: Clean code prioritizes clarity, which makes reading, understanding, and modifying code easier. Writing readable code reduces the time required to grasp the code's functionality, leading to faster development times.Team collaboration: Clear and consistent code facilitates communication and cooperation among team members. By adhering to established coding standards and writing readable code, developers easily understand each other's work and collaborate more effectively.Debugging and issue resolution: Clean code is designed with clarity and simplicity, making it easier to locate and understand specific sections of the codebase. Clear structure, meaningful variable names, and well-defined functions make it easier to identify and resolve issues.Improved quality and reliability: Clean code prioritizes following established coding standards and writing well-structured code. This reduces the risk of introducing errors, leading to higher-quality and more reliable software down the line.Now that we understand why clean code is essential, let's delve into some best practices and principles to help you write clean code.Principles of Clean CodeLike a beautiful painting needs the right foundation and brushstrokes, well-crafted code requires adherence to specific principles. These principles help developers write code that is clear, concise, and, ultimately, a joy to work with.Let's dive in.1. Avoid Hard-Coded NumbersUse named constants instead of hard-coded values. Write constants with meaningful names that convey their purpose. This improves clarity and makes it easier to modify the code.Example:The example below uses the hard-coded number 0.1 to represent a 10% discount. This makes it difficult to understand the meaning of the number (without a comment) and adjust the discount rate if needed in other parts of the function.Before:def calculate_discount(price):  discount = price * 0.1 # 10% discount  return price - discountThe improved code replaces the hard-coded number with a named constant TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT. The name instantly conveys the meaning of the value, making the code more self-documenting. After :def calculate_discount(price): TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1 discount = price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT return price - discountAlso, If the discount rate needs to be changed, it only requires modifying the constant declaration, not searching for multiple instances of the hard-coded number.2. Use Meaningful and Descriptive NamesChoose names for variables, functions, and classes that reflect their purpose and behavior. This makes the code self-documenting and easier to understand without extensive comments. As Robert Martin puts it, “A name should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.”Example:If we take the code from the previous example, it uses generic names like \"price\" and \"discount,\" which leaves their purpose ambiguous. Names like \"price\" and \"discount\" could be interpreted differently without context. Before:def calculate_discount(price): TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1 discount = price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT return price - discountInstead, you can declare the variables to be more descriptive.After:def calculate_discount(product_price):  TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT = 0.1  discount_amount = product_price * TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT  return product_price - discount_amountThis improved code uses specific names like \"product_price\" and \"discount_amount,\" providing a clearer understanding of what the variables represent and how we use them.3. Use Comments Sparingly, and When You Do, Make Them MeaningfulYou don't need to comment on obvious things. Excessive or unclear comments can clutter the codebase and become outdated, leading to confusion and a messy codebase.Example:Before:def group_users_by_id(user_id):  # This function groups users by id  # ... complex logic ...  # ... more code …The comment about the function is redundant and adds no value. The function name already states that it groups users by id; there's no need for a comment stating the same.Instead, use comments to convey the \"why\" behind specific actions or explain behaviors.After:def group_users_by_id(user_id):  \"\"\"Groups users by id to a specific category (1-9).  Warning: Certain characters might not be handled correctly.  Please refer to the documentation for supported formats.  Args:    user_id (str): The user id to be grouped.  Returns:    int: The category number (1-9) corresponding to the user id.  Raises:    ValueError: If the user id is invalid or unsupported.  \"\"\"  # ... complex logic ...  # ... more code …This comment provides meaningful information about the function's behavior and explains unusual behavior and potential pitfalls.4. Write Short Functions That Only Do One ThingFollow the single responsibility principle (SRP), which means that a function should have one purpose and perform it effectively. Functions are more understandable, readable, and maintainable if they only have one job. It also makes testing them very easy. If a function becomes too long or complex, consider breaking it into smaller, more manageable functions.Example:Before:def process_data(data):  # ... validate users...  # ... calculate values ...  # ... format output …This function performs three tasks: validating users, calculating values, and formatting output. If any of these steps fail, the entire function fails, making debugging a complex issue. If we also need to change the logic of one of the tasks, we risk introducing unintended side effects in another task.Instead, try to assign each task a function that does just one thing. After:def validate_user(data):  # ... data validation logic ...def calculate_values(data):  # ... calculation logic based on validated data ...def format_output(data):  # ... format results for display …The improved code separates the tasks into distinct functions. This results in more readable, maintainable, and testable code. Also, If a change needs to be made, it will be easier to identify and modify the specific function responsible for the desired functionality. 5. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle and Avoid Duplicating Code or LogicAvoid writing the same code more than once. Instead, reuse your code using functions, classes, modules, libraries, or other abstractions. This makes your code more efficient, consistent, and maintainable. It also reduces the risk of errors and bugs as you only need to modify your code in one place if you need to change or update it.Example:Before:def calculate_book_price(quantity, price): return quantity * pricedef calculate_laptop_price(quantity, price): return quantity * priceIn the above example, both functions calculate the total price using the same formula. This violates the DRY principle.We can fix this by defining a single calculate_product_price function that we use for books and laptops. This reduces code duplication and helps improve the maintenance of the codebase. After:def calculate_product_price(product_quantity, product_price): return product_quantity * product_price6. Follow Established Code-Writing StandardsKnow your programming language's conventions in terms of spacing, comments, and naming. Most programming languages have community-accepted coding standards and style guides, for example, PEP 8 for Python and Google JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript. Here are some specific examples:Java:Use camelCase for variable, function, and class names.Indent code with four spaces.Put opening braces on the same line.Python:Use snake_case for variable, function, and class names.Use spaces over tabs for indentation.Put opening braces on the same line as the function or class declaration.JavaScript:Use camelCase for variable and function names.Use snake_case for object properties.Indent code with two spaces.Put opening braces on the same line as the function or class declaration.Also, consider extending some of these standards by creating internal coding rules for your organization. This can contain information on creating and naming folders or describing function names within your organization.7. Encapsulate Nested Conditionals into FunctionsOne way to improve the readability and clarity of functions is to encapsulate nested if/else statements into other functions. Encapsulating such logic into a function with a descriptive name clarifies its purpose and simplifies code comprehension. In some cases, it also makes it easier to reuse, modify, and test the logic without affecting the rest of the function.In the code sample below, the discount logic is nested within the calculate_product_discount function, making it difficult to understand at a glance.Example:Before:def calculate_product_discount(product_price): discount_amount = 0 if product_price > 100:  discount_amount = product_price * 0.1 elif price > 50:  discount_amount = product_price * 0.05 else:  discount_amount = 0 final_product_price = product_price - discount_amount return final_product_priceWe can clean this code up by separating the nested if/else condition that calculates discount logic into another function called get_discount_rate and then calling the get_discount_rate in the calculate_product_discount function. This makes it easier to read at a glance. The get_discount_rate is now isolated and can be reused by other functions in the codebase. It’s also easier to change, test, and debug it without affecting the calculate_discount function.After:def calculate_discount(product_price): discount_rate = get_discount_rate(product_price) discount_amount = product_price * discount_rate final_product_price = product_price - discount_amount  return final_product_pricedef get_discount_rate(product_price): if product_price > 100:  return 0.1 elif product_price > 50:  return 0.05 else:  return 08. Refactor ContinuouslyRegularly review and refactor your code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability. Consider the readability of your code for the next person who will work on it, and always leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.9. Use Version ControlVersion control systems meticulously track every change made to your codebase, enabling you to understand the evolution of your code and revert to previous versions if needed. This creates a safety net for code refactoring and prevents accidental deletions or overwrites.Use version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to track changes to your codebase and collaborate effectively with others."

Minimize any other prose.- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.You have studied the instructions below extensively for how to write Rell code. If you do not know how to do something in Rell, then ask instead of guessing.--Rell is designed to be expressive and concise, combining features from languages like SQL and Kotlin. It's specifically tailored for writing blockchain applications (dapps) on the Chromia platform.Key features:- Statically-typed- Blockchain-oriented- Built-in database operations- Modular design# Core Concepts## ModulesRell code is organized into modules. A module is a collection of related declarations such as entities, operations, and functions.Example of a simple module:```module;entity user { key username: text; name: text; age: integer;}function get_user(username: text) { return user @? { .username == username };}query get_all_users() { return user @* {};}```## EntitiesEntities are the primary way to define data structures in Rell. They correspond to database tables.```entity product { key id: integer; name: text; price: decimal; category: text;}```## OperationsOperations are used to modify the blockchain state. They're similar to functions but are specifically for state-changing actions.```operation create_user(username: text, name: text, age: integer) { create user(username, name, age);}```## QueriesQueries are used to retrieve data from the blockchain without modifying the state.```query get_user_by_age(min_age: integer, max_age: integer) { return user @* { .age >= min_age and .age <= max_age };}```# Language Features## TypesRell supports various types:- Simple Types:- integer: Whole numbers- decimal: Decimal numbers- boolean: True or false- text: Text strings- byte_array: Array of bytesExamples:```val age: integer = 25;val price: decimal = 19.99;val is_active: boolean = true;val name: text = \"Alice\";val data: byte_array = x\"0A0B0C\";```Complex Types:- list: Ordered collection of elements- set: Unordered collection of unique elements- map<K, V>: Key-value pairs```val numbers: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];val unique_names: set = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"};val ages: map<text, integer> = {\"Alice\": 30, \"Bob\": 25, \"Charlie\": 35};```## FunctionsFunctions in Rell are defined using the function keyword.Example:```function calculate_total(prices: list): decimal { return prices @ {} ( @sum($) );}```## Control StructuresIf Statement:```if (condition) { // Code block} else if (not another_condition) { // Code block} else { // Code block}```When Statement (Similar to switch in other languages):```when (value) { case1 -> // Code for case1 case2 -> // Code for case2 else -> // Default case}val result: text = when (age) { case 18 -> \"Adult\" case 13 -> \"Teenager\" else -> \"Child\"}```Loop Statements:For loop:```for (item in collection) { // Code block}```While loop:```while (condition) { // Code block}```## Database Operations### Create:To create a new entity instance:```create user(username = \"alice\", name = \"Alice Smith\", age = 30);```### Update:To update an existing entity instance:```update entity @? { .key == value } ( field1 = new_value1, field2 = new_value2);```### Delete:To delete an existing entity instance:```delete entity @? { .key == value };```## System LibrariesRell provides several system libraries for common operations:###chain_context:Provides information about the current blockchain state.```val current_block = chain_context.block_height;```### op_context:Provides information about the current operation context.```val signer = op_context.signer;```### crypto:Provides cryptographic functions.Example:```val hash = crypto.sha256(\"Hello, World!\");```### require Function:Used for asserting conditions. If the condition is false, it throws an error.```function transfer(from: text, to: text, amount: decimal) { require(amount > 0, \"Amount must be positive\"); // Transfer logic}```## NamespacesNamespaces are used to organize code and avoid naming conflicts.```namespace utils { function helper1() { /* ... */ } function helper2() { /* ... */ }}// Usageutils.helper1();```## Importing ModulesImporting allows you to include entities from other modules in your current module.```import my_module;query get_data() { return my_module.some_entity @* {};}```"

      "content": "We're implementing a higher-level control structure for our z80 cellular automata simulation, which we call the \"environmental region grid.\"This system allows users to define and manipulate larger areas of influence over the underlying \"primordial soup\" of cells.Key Concepts:1. Soup Cells: The individual units of our cellular automata, which follow basic rules and interact with their neighbors.2. Regions: Larger areas that encompass multiple soup cells. Each region can have unique properties that influence the behavior of the soup cells within it.3. Environmental Region Grid: A grid overlaid on top of the soup cell grid, dividing the simulation space into discrete regions. This grid can be 4x4, 8x8, or 16x16, allowing for different levels of granularity.4. Region Parameters: Each region has a set of adjustable parameters that affect the soup cells within it. These could include: - Obstacle (A region that blocks the movement of soup cells) - Directional influence (biasing cell interactions in specific directions) - Randomness factor (introducing more or less chaos in cell behavior) - Temperature (affecting overall activity levels) - Energy levels (influencing the likelihood of certain cell states or interactions) - Other custom parameters as needed5. Dynamic Influence: The region parameters dynamically modify the behavior of soup cells, creating areas of distinct characteristics within the larger simulation.6. User Interaction: Users can interact with the simulation by adjusting region parameters in real-time, allowing for on-the-fly modification of the simulation's behavior.7. Visualization: The region grid and its effects are visually represented, allowing users to see the influence of their changes on the simulation.Purpose:This system adds a new layer of complexity and control to the cellular automata simulation. It allows for the creation of diverse environments within a single simulation, enabling users to explore how different regional properties affect the emergent behavior of the cellular automata.By implementing this region grid system, we're providing a powerful tool for users to experiment with large-scale influences on cellular automata behavior, potentially leading to new insights and interesting emergent phenomena.Plan:1. Define the Region Structure:Create a comprehensive data structure to represent each region. This structure should be flexible enough to accommodate various parameters that can influence the behavior of soup cells within that region. Consider including: - Obstacle - Directional influence (for each cardinal direction) - Randomness factor - Temperature - Energy level - Any other relevant parametersEnsure that each parameter is represented by an appropriate data type, typically using floating-point numbers for continuous values or integers for discrete states. This structure will be the foundation of your region system, so design it with extensibility in mind.2. Create the Region Grid:Implement a two-dimensional array to represent the region grid. This grid should be flexible in size, allowing for configurations such as 4x4, 8x8, or 16x16. Each element of this array will be an instance of the region structure defined in step 1. Initialize this grid with default values for all parameters, ensuring a consistent starting state. Consider implementing methods to easily resize the grid and maintain the aspect ratio with the underlying soup cells.3. Implement Soup Cell to Region Mapping:Develop a system to efficiently map each soup cell to its corresponding region. This mapping is crucial for quick lookups during simulation. Create a separate array where each element represents a soup cell and contains the index or reference to its associated region. Implement functions to update this mapping whenever the region grid size changes. Ensure that this mapping system is optimized for performance, as it will be frequently accessed during the simulation.4. Modify the Main Simulation Loop:Update the core simulation logic to incorporate region parameters. For each soup cell update: a. Determine the cell's corresponding region using the mapping created in step 3. b. Retrieve the region's parameters. c. Apply the effects of each parameter to the soup cell's behavior.This might involve adjusting probabilities, modifying state transition rules, or influencing the cell's interaction with neighbors. Ensure that this integration is done efficiently to maintain simulation performance.5. Implement Parameter-Specific Logic:For each parameter in the region structure, create dedicated functions or methods to apply its effects. For example: - Obstacle: Turns the cell into an obstacle, preventing it from being randomly selected, and preventing neighbor soup cells from interacting with it. - Directional influence: Adjust the probability of a cell interacting with neighbors in specific directions. - Randomness: Introduce variability in state transitions or cell behavior. - Temperature: Affect the overall activity level or energy of cells within the region. - Energy level: Influence the likelihood of certain operations or state changes.Design these functions to be modular and easily expandable, allowing for the addition of new parameters in the future without major code restructuring.6. Enhance the WASM Interface:Extend the WebAssembly interface to handle the new region grid system. This involves: a. Creating functions to set and get the entire region grid state, allowing for efficient data transfer between JavaScript and WASM. b. Implementing additional functions for manipulating individual regions or specific parameters. c. Ensuring these functions are properly exported and accessible from the JavaScript side. d. Optimizing data transfer to minimize performance overhead, especially for larger grid sizes.7. Develop the User Interface:Design and implement a comprehensive user interface for manipulating the region grid. This should include: a. A visual representation of the region grid, possibly overlaid on the main simulation view. b. Interactive elements for each region, allowing users to adjust parameters individually. c. Global controls for setting grid size and applying presets. d. A system for selecting different \"brushes\" or tools for painting parameter values across multiple regions. e. Real-time feedback showing the effects of parameter changes on the simulation.Ensure that the UI is intuitive and responsive, providing users with immediate visual feedback on their actions.8. Create a Region Visualization System:Develop a robust visualization system for the regions. This should: a. Visually represent the various parameters of each region, possibly using color coding, patterns, or overlays. b. Update in real-time as parameters are changed, providing immediate feedback to the user. c. Implement different visualization modes to focus on specific parameters or overall region states. d. Ensure that the visualization is clear and distinguishable from the underlying soup cell simulation.9. Implement Data Synchronization:Create an efficient system for keeping the region grid data synchronized between the JavaScript UI and the WASM simulation. This might involve: a. Implementing periodic updates at set intervals. b. Creating an event-driven synchronization system that updates when changes occur. c. Optimizing large data transfers to maintain smooth performance, possibly using typed arrays or other efficient data structures. d. Implementing a queuing system for updates to prevent overwhelming the simulation with rapid changes.10. Update the Shader Code:Modify the fragment shader used for rendering the simulation to incorporate region effects. This involves: a. Passing region data to the shader, either as a texture or uniform array. b. Updating the shader logic to consider region parameters when rendering cells. c. Implementing visual effects that reflect the influence of region parameters, such as color shifts, intensity variations, or particle effects. d. Optimizing the shader code to maintain performance, especially for larger simulations or complex region effects.This system will allow for complex, user-defined behaviors across the simulation space, significantly enhancing the depth and interactivity of the cellular automata simulation."

      "content": "# Project SynopsisPyllments is a Python library for building graphical and API-based LLM applications through chaining together Elements in a potentially cyclic graph. Elements and Payloads are a type of Components. A Component is composed of a Model and Views. The Model handles the underlying data and logic, while the Views are the UI components that are used to display display the interactive UI used to interact with the Model. An Element is a type of Component that is responsible for a specific function. For instance, an Element can handle the LLM selection and generation by making calls to LLM providers. Another Element may handle the chat interface, whose Model would store the chat message history, and the Views would be the text boxes and buttons used to interact with the chat interface. Elements are meant to connect to other Elements through Ports. All that is necessary to link Elements together is to link the output port of one Element to the input port of Another. Each output port may have unlimited input ports it connects to, and each input port may have unlimited output ports it connects to. The ports follow an observer pattern where the output port is the subject and the input port is the observer. The subject notifies the observers when a certain event that we set within the Element is triggered. In order to connect an input and and output port, they need to be setup in a manner that sends and receives the same type of Payload. A Payload is also a Component with a Model as well as views responsible for the display logic. Elements may receive payloads and use methods of the Payload to generate the views for the UI. The sending Element is responsible for packing data into the Payload.  I am currently working on making this a fully-fledged framework.# Project OrganizationHere is an example of the file structure of an individual element:chat_interface:  - __init__.py  - chat_interface_element.py  - chat_interface_model.py  - css:    - buttons.css    - column.css    - input.css# Primary Libraries Used- Panel is used to create the visualization layer and run the GUI. Views tend to consist of Panel objects which can be styled with Python and CSS.- Param is used to create parameterized classes which help create parameters that handle type validation, default values, constraints, and most importantly, reactivity(setting event handlers to catch changes).- Langchain is responsible for the specific functions pertaining to incorporating LLM workflows.# Development PrioritiesPyllments code is prioritized on being developer-friendly, where extensibility and modularity are first-class citizens. Elements should be customizeable with clean and intuitive interfaces. It should also be easy to create new elements depending on the needs of the developer. # DocumentationDocstrings should use a NumPy/SciPy style."
